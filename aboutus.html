         Ameen Jalali younger brother of Ameer Jalali also known as Carnage. The best out of all of us even its only because the fact he had a 2000 hours head start otherwise Vertical the upcoming star is considered to take over him is a short period of time.
         He was one of the co-founders of Grim Clan which started during Covid-19 as a CS-GO funny skits channel. Due to his pior expreince in world of war craft and Dota 1 he considered to be the best IGL (in game leader) of all time.
         People refer to him as irani sometimes as his father is from iran and mother from pakistan that makes him a 100% irani cus science. Anti-mage is considered to be his best hero with a win rate of 90% meaning out 10 games he only loses 1 game a pretty decent win to lose ratio.
         Dota buff ranks him the 3 best AM player just before his favourite hard carry miracle who currently plays for a washed up Div 2 team called Nigma filled with a bunch of old dudes who should just retire, just like their hair their skills are falling off estimating to not even be in division 2 by next year most likely dropping to div 3.

        Tabish Memon Khan son of Aijaz Muhammad originally from Ohio, Legend has it <strong>PUDGE was designed/inspired after him</strong>. Words cannot describe his skills, one of <strong>THE BEST</strong> players of dota to have ever lived. Legend has it his brother practices his boxing skills on him (while being naked). People are so scared of him when he ques into a game and the enemy see his name they surrender without a heart-beat.
        He has mastered all 123 heros of dota and he is the one that guides the game developers to bring out new heros and map changes. Without his approval not a single ward can be placed in DOTA. He is one of the top 4 doctors out of the 4 in the world, first place being Rayyan Afzal second place being Hassam while some of his fat is sliding into second place but most of it is in third and fourth place. He also suffers from unrecognizable diesases which are being currently being researched by our top doctor <strong>RAYYAN AFZAL</strong>, when asked the doctor said,"Idk he is retarted but i like men."
